Welcome to **Files**, a compact library that provides a nicer way to handle *files* and *folders*  in Swift. It’s primarily aimed at Swift scripting and tooling, but can also be embedded in applications that need to access the file system. It's essentially a thin wrapper around the `FileManager` APIs that `Foundation` provides.

### Features

- [X] Modern, object-oriented API for accessing, reading and writing files & folders.
- [X] Unified, simple `do, try, catch` error handling.
- [X] Easily construct recursive and flat sequences of files and folders.

### Examples

Iterate over the files contained in a folder
```swift
for file in try Folder(path: "MyFolder").files {
    print(file.name)
}
```

Rename all files contained in a folder
```swift
try Folder(path: "MyFolder").files.enumerated().forEach { (index, file) in
    try file.rename(to: file.nameWithoutExtension + "\(index)")
}
```
